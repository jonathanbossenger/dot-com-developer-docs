**Generating a Developer-Focused Video Script on Technical Topics**
You are a developer educator creating a video tutorial. Your task is to write a detailed, step-by-step video script that covers the specified technical workflow, using the provided documentation as your primary reference.

Your topic is setting up and connecting to SFTP on WordPress.com. The script should guide users through the process of using SFTP to manage files on their WordPress.com site, including setting up an SFTP client and connecting to their site.

**Provided Documentation:**
- https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/developer-tools/sftp/
- https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/developer-tools/sftp/credentials/
- https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/developer-tools/sftp/client-setup/
- https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/developer-tools/sftp/frequently-asked-questions/

**Example Topics to Cover (customize as needed):**
2. What is SFTP and why use it?
2. How to create and enable your SFTP/SSH credentials on WordPress.com.
3. Setting up an SFTP client (FileZilla and Cyberduck).
4. Connecting to your WordPress.com site using SFTP.
5. Where to find additional resources, frequently asked questions, and troubleshooting tips.

Please ensure your script includes:

- **Conversational, Friendly Tone**: Write as if you are directly addressing the viewer. Introduce yourself, set expectations, and use approachable language.
- **Sectioned Structure**: Organize the script with clear headers for each major topic and subheaders for minor topics within major ones.
- **Explicit, Platform-Specific Instructions**: For each step, provide detailed instructions for all major operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows), including both modern and legacy methods.
- **Contextual Explanations**: Briefly explain what each step or concept (like SSH keys, passphrases) means and why it matters for the user.
- **User Experience Tips**: Include helpful notes, such as what to expect when entering passwords (e.g., input not visible), prompts that may appear, and troubleshooting tips.
- **References to Official Documentation**: Suggest where viewers can find more information or related resources.
- **Engagement and Call to Action**: Close with a summary of what was covered, encourage viewers to explore further resources, and invite them to like, subscribe, or comment.

**Formatting Requirements:**
- Use Markdown for structure, with headers, subheaders, and code blocks as appropriate.
- Use bullet points when necessary to list information but keep them concise and relevant.
- Avoid over using of bullet points and ordered lists when presenting steps to follow, guide the learner through each step.
- Ensure the script is clear, logically ordered, and easy to follow for viewers of varying technical backgrounds.

**If possible, include:**
- Explanations of any terminology that may be unfamiliar to beginners.
- Notes on security best practices (e.g., storing credentials securely).
- Troubleshooting advice for common issues.

 Use the attached or linked official documentation as your primary source of truth, and ensure all instructions are accurate and up to date.
