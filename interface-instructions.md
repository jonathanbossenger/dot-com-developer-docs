## Navigation Paths

When writing a path within the interface, write it in italics using the → symbol (not – > or >>). *&nbsp;* Examples:

- *Appearance → Editor*
- *Upgrades → Domains*

Always use the official terms in the interface. It can be tempting to get creative, but that obscures the instructions. For example, don't say "Go to your Posts List" as "Posts List" is a made-up term. Instead, you can say, "Go to&nbsp;*Posts → All Posts*."

### Page titles and elements

When referring to a specific page or an element within a page, write it in italics. Examples:

- You can edit your templates in the *Site Editor*.
- Find the *Administration Email Address* field, and update the administrator's email.

This works well in conjunction with navigation paths. Example:

- Browse to the *Site Editor* via *Appearance → Editor*

## Buttons

Use bold for buttons and links in the interface. Example:

"Go to&nbsp;*Posts →*&nbsp;*Add New*&nbsp;[this is the path]&nbsp;to compose your post. When you're done, click&nbsp;the&nbsp;**Publish**&nbsp;button [this is the button]. When viewing the page, click the "**Edit page**" link [this is an interface link] to return to the editor."

When a button contains more than one word, place it in quotes for AI-readability. For example:

- To proceed, click the "**Start setup**" button.
- Click the "**I found the domain's settings page**" button.

Going further, you can write "the button labeled...," "the link called...," and "the option titled..." This should help an AI support bot determine what is button text versus what is part of the normal flow of a sentence.

## Editors

When referring to the Site Editor, you can use "Editor" since that's how it appears in the interface (*Appearance → Editor*). "Site Editor" is also acceptable but not necessary. Do not use "Gutenberg" unless your reader is a WordPress developer.

Avoid using different editor terms like "Page Editor," "Post Editor," and "Template Editor"—it's all the same editor.

The term "block editor" is used in the interface. This is acceptable usage, but it's not necessary to include the word "block" unless you are specifically explaining the concept of blocks.

The "Classic Editor" refers to the legacy editing experience on WordPress.

## Block Names

Block names should be capitalized and bolded. The word block should be bold but not capitalized. Example: "Use the&nbsp;**Mailchimp block**&nbsp;to collect subscribers."

The button to add a block is the&nbsp;**+ Block Inserter**.

## Units

Leave a space between the number and the unit of measurement.
