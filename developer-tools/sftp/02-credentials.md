# Find Your SFTP/SSH Credentials

To access your site's SFTP and SSH credentials, take the following steps:

1. Visit your site's dashboard and navigate to *Hosting → Overview* (or *Settings → Hosting Configuration* if using the default interface style).
2. Click the **Settings** tab.
3. Click **SFTP/SSH** in the sidebar.
4. Click the "**Create credentials**" button.

In a few moments, your site's credentials will appear for both SFTP and SSH connections:

* URL address
* Port Number
* Username
* Password

Click the **Copy** button next to any value to copy it to your device's clipboard.

The username and password are generated by the system automatically. These are unique to your site, so if you have multiple sites, you'll use multiple usernames and passwords, one for each site, in your SFTP client.

Under "SSH Access" you can toggle on the "**Enable SSH access to this site**" option. A connection command will appear which can be copied and pasted into a terminal application:

For security reasons, we do not store your SFTP/SSH password. If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it by clicking the "**Reset password**" button that appears after you navigate away from the *Configuration* screen and back again.
