# Find Your SFTP/SSH Credentials

> Because SFTP uses the SSH protocol, if you've already [enabled SSH](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/developer-tools/ssh/enable/) on your site, you can use the same credentials for SFTP.

To access your site's SFTP credentials for the first time, take the following steps:

1. Visit your site's dashboard and navigate to the site’s *Settings* page. This may be slightly different depending on your chosen Admin Interface Style.
    1. If you’re using the Classic style: *Hosting → Site Settings*
    2. If you’re using the Default style: *Settings → Server Settings*
2. Click on the **SFTP/SSH** tab.

3. Click "**Create credentials**". This only needs to be done once and will generate the SFTP username and password for the selected site. The credentials will be used for both SFTP and SSH connections.
4. If you’ve already created the credentials before, they will be displayed, but you'll need to use the "**Reset password"** button to generate a new one.

5. Store the password in a safe place. If you lose or forget your password, the "**Reset password**" button can be used to generate a new one.

The SFTP/SSH credentials will be displayed in the following format:

* URL address
* Port Number
* Username
* Password

Click the **Copy** button next to any value to copy it to your device's clipboard.

The username and password are generated by the system automatically. These are unique to your site, so if you have multiple sites, you'll use multiple usernames and passwords, one for each site, in your SFTP client.

Under "SSH Access" you can toggle on the "**Enable SSH access to this site**" option. A connection command will appear which can be copied and pasted into a terminal application:

For security reasons, we do not store your SFTP/SSH password. 

If you've forgotten your password, when you navigate back to the site’s *Settings* you can use the  "**Reset password**" button to rest your password.
