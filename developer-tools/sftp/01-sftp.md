# Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)

Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a secure FTP method to transfer files to and from your site. This guide will show you how to use SFTP on WordPress.com.

> This feature is available on sites with the [WordPress.com Business or Commerce plan](https://wordpress.com/hosting/?ref=developer-docs#pricing-grid).

## About SFTP

SFTP is a method to access the files and folders on a website via a client program such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) on your local computer. SFTP stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol (or SSH File Transfer Protocol). It was designed as an extension of the SSH (Secure SHell) protocol. The "secure" part is because it is run over a secure channel, in this case, SSH.

SFTP is not to be confused with FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which is similar but not secure.

You can test code and file changes first on a [staging site](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/developer-tools/staging-sites/).
