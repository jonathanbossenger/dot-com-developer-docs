# Frequently Asked Questions

Connecting to SSH to run terminal commands on your server can be confusing when you’ve never used it before. Below, you’ll find answers to some of the most frequently asked questions when working with SSH for the first time.

## Can I get support for using command-line tools?

Due to the complex nature of SSH and WP-CLI, we are not able to provide extensive support for using these tools. Happiness Engineers are available to help with issues connecting via SSH, but cannot guide you through using commands.

## Are all commands available?

In order to provide a secure and performant environment, WordPress.com may restrict or disable certain shell and WP-CLI commands. The WP-CLI docs provide a list of available [WP CLI commands](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/developer-tools/wp-cli/platform-commands/).

## Can I set my own SSH password?

The username and password are generated by the system automatically. These are unique to each site. If you have multiple sites, you'll need to use multiple usernames and passwords, one for each site.

## Can I have multiple SSH keys?

You can only add one SSH key per WordPress.com account, which you can then attach to multiple sites. Each site can have multiple keys attached, one per privileged user.
