# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I get support for using command line tools?

Due to the complex nature of SSH and WP-CLI, we are not able to provide extensive support for using these tools. Happiness Engineers are available to help with issues connecting via SSH but cannot guide you through using commands.

## Are all commands available?

In order to provide a secure and performant environment, WordPress.com may restrict or disable certain shell and WP-CLI commands.

## Can I set my own SSH password?

The username and password are generated by the system automatically. These are unique to each site. If you have multiple sites, you'll need to use multiple usernames and passwords, one for each site.

## Can I have multiple SSH keys?

You can only add one key per WordPress.com account, which you can then attach to multiple sites. Each site can have multiple keys attached, one per privileged user.
